# Bank_Loan_Excel_DA_Project

Project Summary: Financial Loan Data Analysis and Visualization

This project involved comprehensive data analysis, processing, and transformation of financial loan data within the finance domain, 
leveraging Excel for actionable insights and interactive visualization. Key steps included data cleansing, structuring, and streamlining 
to ensure accurate categorization of loans into Good Loans and Bad Loans based on criteria such as loan status (Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off), 
funded amounts received, average interest rates, and Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios.

The Summary Dashboard presents key performance indicators (KPIs), including the number and funded amounts of good and bad loans. 
These metrics were derived through data aggregation and analysis using pivot tables, enhanced with slicers for dynamic filtering and pivot charts for data-driven visual exploration.

The Overview Dashboard further segments financial loan applications by dimensions such as month, state, term, employee length, loan purpose, and homeownership. 
Data visualization techniques, including pivot charts and slicers, were applied to uncover trends and patterns, enabling deeper insights into the dataset.

This project showcases expertise in data analysis methodologies, including data transformation, KPI calculation, and 
advanced Excel features like pivot tables, slicers, and charts, to deliver a robust analytical framework for understanding financial loan data. 
The approach underscores the ability to turn raw data into meaningful insights for strategic decision-making within the finance domain.
